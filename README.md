# DataPond
A questionable way of storing and fetching JSON documents on the filesystem.

## Why?
I needed a percistant data storage mechanism for a small project, and had a few stipulations:

- I didn't want to spin up a database server anywhere
- I didn't want to rely on sqlite
- I wanted an excuse to play with `groq-js`

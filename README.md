# DataPond
A questionable way of storing and fetching JSON documents on the filesystem.

### Why?
I needed a persistent data storage mechanism for a small project, and had a few stipulations:

- I didn't want to spin up a database server anywhere
- I didn't want to use sqlite
- I wanted an excuse to play with `groq-js`

## Running
`npm run`
